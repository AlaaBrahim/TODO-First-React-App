# TodoList App

Welcome to my first React project! This repository contains a responsive TodoList app built using React, HTML, and styled with PicoCSS. With this app, you can conveniently add, remove, and update tasks, and it also provides user-specific task storage in the browser. Additionally, you can enjoy the visual appeal of both light and dark mode themes.
